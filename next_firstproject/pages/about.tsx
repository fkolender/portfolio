    <p>My name is Francisco Kolender, I'm a 20 year old IT Analyst student from Montevideo, Uruguay. I'm on the look for my first opportunity & eager to prove myself. Currently finishing the first year of an IT career. I’m quick to pick up anything on the fly and delve deeper no matter the subject, much more enthusiastic if it’s tech-related. Technology has always been a part of my life, be it in the shape of hardware, contributing scripts to open source communities, modding games or curiosity.</p>
